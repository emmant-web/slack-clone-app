# Slack Clone App

A real-time chat application inspired by Slack, built with **React**. The app includes **user registration**, **login**, and **messaging functionality**, allowing users to send messages to others in the app.

This was our second major React project, where we explored **React Router** for navigation. We used a combination of **Material UI components** and **custom HTML/CSS** to design the interface, giving us hands-on experience with both component libraries and manual styling.
